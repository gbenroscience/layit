# layit
Its an android xml style layout library for web interfaces
Layouts on steroids with android-style xml constraint-layouts on the web, backed by autolayout.js!

This project already works, but is currently under development and new ui widgets are been added to it.

You can achieve very complex layouts very quickly using constraints. In addition, we adopted the cool xml style of Google's android xml layouts which allow you build layouts very quickly instead of the weird but **powerful?** syntax of VFL and EVFL.
